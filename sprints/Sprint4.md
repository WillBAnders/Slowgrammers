# Sprint 4

Goal: Finish implementing mutable routes (profile editing) and finalize project
for submission (style cleanup, error handling, and deployment).

## Accomplishments

- Project
    - Deployment via Github Pages & Heroku (https://willbanders.dev/TutorsVILLE)
    - Implemented creating tutor accounts and editing the tutor profile,
      particularly availability (required backend schema changes).
- Frontend
    - Added eslint/prettier linting to ensure a standardized code style.
    - Added Gravitar profile images (generated by username).
    - Ensured proper loading/error states for pages making API requests.
    - Created utilities for mocking console, alert, and fetch to ensure proper
      state management and error on unexpected calls.
    - Refactored main page components to cleanup logic, standardize user
      interfaces, and implement missing tests.
- Backend
    - Standardized the handling of user/tutor data throughout the API to ensure
      that tutors are always a supertype of users.
    - Implement username/password validation for /signup.
    - Fixed PATCH /profile handling of default values.
    - Hid tutor contact information from unauthenticated users.
    - Setup CORS configuration for deployment.
