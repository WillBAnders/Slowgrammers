# Sprint 1

Goal: Create a basic single-page app that allows viewing core computer science
courses at UF, the available tutors for each course, and a tutor's profile page
containing their contact information.

## Accomplishments

 - Frontend
    - Created the above pages for courses, course tutors, and tutor information
      as well as a page for displaying all tutors.
    - Added a landing page with navigation and basic information.
    - Started login/signup pages, but still need to do validation logic and
      backend integration.
 - Backend
    - Successfully setup project with Golang, Gin (routing), and Gorm (database
      ORM).
    - Added routes for the above frontend pages (`/courses`, `/courses:code`,
      `/tutors`, `/tutors/:username`)
    - Started work on a setup script and testing, but this requires a redesign
      of the backend structure. The research for this is mostly complete.
